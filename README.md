# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression  
  
Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on health indicators. The dataset used here is [**Framingham Heart Study Data**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset), a cardiovascular study conducted on residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. This model analyzes multiple risk factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking habits - key factors in assessing heart disease risk.

## Structure  
The project is organized into the following files:  
- `Heart-Disease-Logistic-Regression.ipynb` – Implementation.  
- `framingham.csv` – Dataset.
- `README.md` – Documentation.  

## Requirements 
To run this project, Python and Jupyter Notebook should be installed. The required libraries are:  

1. **numpy**
2. **pandas**
3. **matplotlib**
4. **seaborn**
5. **scikit-learn**

## Methodology Used
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing key features and analyzing correlations.  
2. **Model Training** – Implementing Logistic Regression and training it on structured data.  
3. **Evaluation** – Measuring the model’s accuracy using a confusion matrix and classification report.  

## Results  
The model was trained and tested on the [**Framingham**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset) dataset, achieving an accuracy of **85%** on test data. Its performance is evaluated using a **confusion matrix** and **classification report** which show precision, recall, and F1-score for each category.
